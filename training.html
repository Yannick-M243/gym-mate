                            Even if your diet is the most important, if you don’t train correctly according to your
                            goal,
                            you will not get the
                            result expected. For people who have never been to the gym and want to start working out, I
                            would advise you to
                            take a personal trainer that will teach you all the exercises execution, it might cost you
                            money, but you don’t have to
                            keep training with him/her in long term. To get started you must find someone experienced
                            who
                            can show you the moves,
                            otherwise, you might get injured or waste your time.

                            For now, I will be providing advice only for the two people's most common goals, which are
                            weight loss/shredding, and
                            muscle gain/bulking.

                <h2>Wheight loss / Shredding</h2>
                <div class="container">
                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p>If you are training to lose fat or to shred, the first thing you should know is you cannot
                            target
                            a specific part of
                            your body to lose weight, the weight loss is global, and the best and only way to lose fat
                            wherever it is on your body
                            is to burn calories.</p>
                        <p>The best way to burn calories is to do a lot of cardio (running, skipping rope, cycling, and
                            so
                            on). So, if your gym
                            session also includes weightlifting, know that you will need to spend more time on cardio
                            than
                            weightlifting.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p>Besides the cardio, when you workout to shred I will advise you to favorise a dynamic workout
                            and
                            to do longer
                            repetitions and more sets, for example, if you normally do 3 sets of 10 repetitions, change
                            it
                            to 4 sets of 15
                            repetitions with a lighter weight.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>The clue is to burn as many calories as you can, the more calories you burn the more fat you
                            lose.

                            Bonus: Regardless of if you are shredding or bulking, you must organise your work, g with
                            the gym with a plan, don’t
                            start think about what you’re going to train once you got to the gym.

                            Don’t try to do a full body workout every day, you can focus your workout on 2 part of the
                            body per day, so you work
                            better on those parts, and you let them recover while you are training other parts which
                            create like a cycle where you
                            can exercise and recover effectively.

                        <p>If you are training to build muscles your workout is going to be different, instead of doing
                            more
                            cardiovascular, here
                            you can do a bit of cardio to warm up and avoid injuries, but everything will happen in the
                            weightlifting part of the
                            workout.</p>
                        <p>Instead of doing more repetitions with light weights here You will he to do fewer repetitions
                            with heavier weights, for
                            example, if you normally do 4 sets of 10 reps now you must do 8 or 6 reps each set with
                            heavier
                            weight.</p>

                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p>The most common error people do while training for bulking is to go too heavier and to start
                            paying less attention to
                            the exercise execution. That’s very wrong and dangerous, always prioritize the execution
                            over
                            the weight, try to do
                            clean sets, and lift heavier at the same time.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>Concerning the body types, Endomorphs and Mesomorph do not really have issues while bulking
                            but
                            ectomorphs can struggle
                            to get started, it will require a lot of discipline and determination.
