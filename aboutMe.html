                        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                        <p>My name is Yannick, I am passionate about gym/fitness since I was young.
                            I have about 8 years of experience in the field, and during those years I have been trained
                            by
                            many
                            differents coaches
                            including international professional bodybuilder, I have trained for many different goals
                            and reached
                            them during my fitness journey(fat loss, shredding, bulking, and more), I have also tried
                            and
                            followed a lot of
                            diet plans and nutrition programs.</p>
                        <h2>Experience</h2>
                        <p>
                            I don't have any certification as a professional personal trainer but I have the passion and
                            years
                            of experience.
                            I have never tried to make money as a personal trainer or coach because I have other plans
                            for
                            the futur
                            but I have trained
                            few people who showed impressive results by training with me and following the personalized
                            diet plans I made for them.
                            Even if can't train people at the gym, I am constantly providing them with good advice, this
                            is
                            my way of sharing my experience on the side and pursuing
                            my other goals.
