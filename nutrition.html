                    I always say nutrition is the key to success, let’s say nutrition is about 70% of the results you
                    will get. That’s why
                    it is important to know how to eat according to your body type. I you eat well you are halfway
                    there.
                </p>
                <span>For now, I will be providing advice only for the two people's most common goals, which are fat
                    loss/shredding, and muscle gain/bulking.</span>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Fat loss / Shredding</h2>
                <p>To lose fat, you must avoid foods containing fat, soft drinks (sodas, juices, beers, …) sauces
                    (ketchup,
                    mayonnaise, ...), eat smaller quantities, and cook with a minimum of oil (olive or coconut oil),
                    avoid
                    salt and spices containing salt. The fewer calories you eat the more likely you are to lose weight.
                    You
                    can stay on 3 meals a day basis but make sure to eat smaller quantities and clean food. What I mean
                    by
                    clean food is: a good source of protein (fish, chicken, beef, egg white), green vegetables and carbs
                    (In
                    small quantity).
                </p><br>
                <p>Losing fat is different than shredding. When you are shredding you must make sure to have enough
                    protein
                    and more carbs
                    in your food to avoid muscle loss.
