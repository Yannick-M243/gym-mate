                            I always say nutrition is the key to success, let’s say nutrition is about 70% of the
                            results
                            you
                            will get. That’s why
                            it is important to know how to eat according to your body type. If you eat well you are
                            halfway
                            there.

                            fat
                            loss/shredding, and muscle gain/bulking.

                            day
                            basis but make sure to
                            eat smaller quantities and clean food. What I mean by clean food is: a good source of
                            protein
                            (fish, chicken, beef, egg
                            white), green vegetables and carbs (In small quantity)

                        <p>Losing fat is different than shredding. When you are shredding you must make sure to have
                            enough
                            protein and more carbs
                            in your food to avoid muscle loss.

                            what
                            some people say. Use oil or coconut

                        <p>Most of the time gaining muscle comes with gaining fat too because muscle gain workout
                            requires
                            more
                            energy, and that
                            energy comes with the food you eat. To gain muscle some people eat 5 times per day, but I
                            recommend
                            4 times per day
                            (each 3-4 hours).
